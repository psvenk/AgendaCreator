# AgendaCreator

AgendaCreator *(working title)* is a tool written in HTML and JavaScript which
gives students a simple interface for creating a planner to keep track of their
duties in their classes.

## Supported browsers
Because AgendaCreator is still in the beta stage, I am not yet very concerned
about browser support, but you are free to open an issue on GitHub with any
compatibility issues. I plan to support most browsers made in the last 8 years,
and Internet Explorer 9. I have no plans to support Internet Explorer 6 or
below; people on Windows 95, 98, 2000, ME, and XP can download an older version
of Firefox or Opera (95/98/ME may need to use KernelEx), or they could install
a lightweight GNU+Linux distribution instead of using an aging OS with security
holes.

## Reporting bugs
Please report any bugs that you find in GitHub issues.
